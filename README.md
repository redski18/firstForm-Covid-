#COVID Patient Information Form
This is a simple patient information form created as a school project. The form takes information about a patient's contact information, vaccination history, and symptoms, and writes the information into a text file.

# Usage
The patient information form consists of several fields that the user can fill out:

Name: The patient's name
Address: The patient's address
Phone number: The patient's phone number
Email address: The patient's email address
Vaccination history: Checkboxes indicating which vaccines the patient has received
Symptoms: Checkboxes indicating the patient's symptoms
Once the user has filled out all the necessary information, they can click the "Submit" button to save the information to a text file.
